(Not in any particular order)

1. Verify checksums before installing.

2. Add an automatic-update script (runs when user logs into computer). 

3. Add updater for Atom Stable (may collaborate).

4. Consider a single script that detects the distro and downloads the proper
   files. Very complex and greatly adds to script length!

5. Consider writing in C rather than script. Not likely for a while.
