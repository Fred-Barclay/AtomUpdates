# AtomUpdates

### Currently only supports Debian and openSUSE, and distros based on them.  
May add support for others later

AtomUpdates hosts intelligent scripts for detecting your current version of
Atom, checking for updates, and then downloading the proper update package if
needed. The scripts are fully customisable but offer reasonable choices
out-of-the-box.

If your detected version of Atom is the same as the latest release, the script
will automatically terminate. If you have an outdated version, the script, at
your prompting, download and install the latest version.

# Licensing:
The scripts hosted in this repository are provided under a dual-license model:    
(a). GPL v2 or, (at your option) any later version.    
(b). Custom, highly-permissive licensing terms.

A copy of the GPL v2 is found in the GPLv2_LICENSE file, and a copy of the
custom licensing terms is found in the LICENSE file, as well as in the code
itself.
