#AtomUpdates
AtomUpdates hosts intelligent scripts for detecting your current version of
Atom, checking for updates, and then downloading the proper update package if
needed. The scripts are fully customisable but offer reasonable choices
out-of-the-box.

If the installed version of Atom is the same as the latest release, the script
will automatically terminate. If you have an outdated version, the script, at
your prompting, downloads and install the latest version.

Currently, only Atom Beta is updated. We will soon add a script for updating
Atom Stable as well.

#Supported Linux Distros:
**Debian**  
Debian  
Ubuntu  
Linux Mint  
LMDE  

**Red Hat**  
Fedora  
CentOS  

**Others**  
openSUSE

If you don't see your distro listed here, but it uses either dpkg/apt
or rpm/yum/dnf/zypper, chances are it's supported too!  

The precompiled Atom binaries are only for 64-bit distros. If you only have a
32-bit machine, you should either compile the source code yourself or look for a
**trusted** third-party precompiled binary. For example, there is a Ubuntu PPA
that offers 32-bit Atom binaries.

To request support for another distro, or to let us know that an unlisted distro
works, please open an Issue or submit a pull request.
